\section{Introduction}
I generate some simple scenes and objects in Unity3d, and walk in the scene and render it into images sequences. Then feed these images into LSD SLAM. I find it comes in great handy if I want to test the feature of a algorithm. Just by causally adjusting the setting of the scene, I find that:\\
1, The width of view is very important in tracking.\\
2, If you want to get the dense points of a object, you should make the object cover the major area of the rendered image. Otherwise, it is very easy to lose tracking.\\
